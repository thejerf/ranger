A repo for playing with the ability to range over functions in Go.

This is as alpha as alpha can be. I reserve the right to even _change the
repo name_, let alone API stability. (The underlying functionality isn't
even stable.)

You will need to be on gotip 510541 for this (or some subsequent
release). See [this post, under "Trying This Proposal
Today"](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2023/preview-ranging-over-functions-in-go/).
